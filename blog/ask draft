>> I've read several things on fibromyalgia and honestly all the symptom lists are basically a personal checklist for me. I mentioned this to my mom, but all she told me is that my dad (who is a doctor) is of the party that sort of believes it's just overly misdiagnosed and most patients just use it as an excuse to be lazy. Or something like that. I've been trying to get a diagnosis that will explain my symptoms for a while now, but I just don't know how to proceed from here.

>> You guys have any advice on alternatives for chronic pain rather than taking acetaminophen? I heard taking Tylenol on the daily is bad for the kidneys and I already have problems that put my kidneys at risk. I don't know what else there is to do though. I barely started taking them to help and I feel so great ever since. I don't wanna go back to being all achy and hurting again.

>> Can you recommend any makeup blogs geared towards spoonies? I want to wear makeup more often but I don't usually have the energy and executive function to manage it.

>> im an undiagnosed sophomore in high school (i have hypersomnia and pretty sure my joint pain is fibro but it's not "Official" yet) and im wondering when should one know that they need a cane. On my bad days, I can't put weight on one side of my body because it hurts so much. I'm a sophomore so im even more scared of being socially shunned. when you search for canes online you dont necessarily see fashionistas or cool kids using them. any tips?

>> Hi! I have what I think is IBS, and it seriously puts a damper on my day-to-day activities, like leaving the house. I have a doctor's appointment scheduled, and I plan to bring it up then. Do you have any advice on coping with it?
