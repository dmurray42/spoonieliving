			<h1>Welcome To Spoonie Living!</h1>
			<hr>
			<br>
			<p>
				We're stoked that you've stopped by! Whether you're a patient, friend or family to one, a caregiver, or a health services provider, we know you'll find something useful on our site.
			</p>
			<p>
				Spoonie Living started when I saw a need for a resource-heavy (and filler-low) blog for folks with chronic illnesses and disabilities, and has since grown into a hub for folks with disabilities and those in their lives.
			</p>
			<p>
				What qualifies a person as a spoonie? Oh boy, so many things! Mental illnesses, congenital conditions, intellectual disabilities, learning disorders... if something about your body (including your brain) is different, and makes it harder to get through your daily life, then congratulations: you're a spoonie. So, take a look around and see what grabs you!
			</p>
			<p>
				Love and spoons,
