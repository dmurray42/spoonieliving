		<div>
			<p>Illustrated with beautiful watercolor paintings, <a href="https://howtogeton.wordpress.com">How to Get On</a> is "a little spoonie guide on how to navigate 'the system' and how to live a great, disabled life."</p>

			<p>The site contains articles on applying for and receiving disability benefits, and a whole lot more!</p>

			<p>The resources here are mostly US-based, but the advice will likely be a big help for folks from other countries, too.</p>

		</div>
		<div>
			<p>This incredible site covers all sorts of healthy communication, life skills, and social skills for folks who want to be autonomous and self-realized.</p>

			<p>While <a href="http://realsocialskills.org">Real Social Skills for Autonomous People</a> is a more general blog, it does cross over into spoonie topics often and is a real boon for people navigating illness and disability.</p>

			<p>Articles cover boundaries, how to do various things, power dynamics, abuse, ableism, and more. The author is autistic and writes what they know, so articles are both accessible and specifically useful to autistic folks.</p>
