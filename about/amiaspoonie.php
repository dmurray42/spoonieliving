<p>We get this question a lot at Spoonie Living! Here is a snarky (but also friendly and full of love!)&nbsp;representation of the conversation we might have:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I a spoonie if&ndash;&rdquo;</p>

<p style="line-height: 19.6px;">If you have to ask, you probably are one :)</p>
<p style="line-height: 19.6px;">A spoonie is a person with any kind of physical and/ormental&nbsp;illness, disability, or significant difference from most of the world in how they function. This means that unlike most people, you have to really ration your physical and/or emotional energy as you go about day-to-day living.</p>
