				Hello there, and welcome to Spoonie Living!

Spoonie Living is a lifestyle blog √† la Martha Stewart Living for folks with chronic illness who aren‚Äôt going to let their health problems keep them from living a fantastic life. Here you‚Äôll find spoonie-specific advice, products, reviews, as well as life hacks and awesome mods of all sorts of medical devices‚Äìso give us a follow and start living the spoonie life with us!

We‚Äôre also on Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest.

We know what oppression feels like firsthand, and make it our goal to keep this blog a safe space for all marginalized groups‚Äìchronically ill and otherwise. Spoonie Living practices compassionate intersectional feminism by avoiding racist, appropriative, cissexist, and other -ist language in our original content, and tagging for the same in the content of others.

We acknowledge that no one can be completely unproblematic all the time, so if you see something we‚Äôve overlooked, or simply have a personal trigger you‚Äôd like us to tag for, please feel free to check in. We aren‚Äôt able to answer all anonymous asks, but we‚Äôll always listen and take appropriate action. We‚Äôre also happy to have a private conversation either via email or non-anon asks.

‚Äî

Spoonie Living is curated by Diane of Portland, OR. Helping her out with image captions is the delightful Logan (they/them pronouns).

Have a blog of your own and want to write or solicit a guest post? Have a product you‚Äôd like us to advertise or review? Want to collaborate on a project? Drop us a line‚Äìwe love making new friends!

FAQs

üíä What‚Äôs all this with the spoons?

The term ‚Äúspoonie‚Äù refers to a person with a chronic illness of some type (mental or physical) that has a serious impact on their daily life. It comes from Christine Miserando‚Äôs Spoon Theory story, and it‚Äôs resonated with so many people that it‚Äôs spawned its own term, used by spoonies all over!

üíä Do I count as a spoonie?

We get this question all the time, and the answer is: if you‚Äôre asking, you probably do! If you spend a significant time during your average day caring for yourself or measuring out your emotional and/or physical resources to decide what you can and can‚Äôt afford to do‚Äìwell, welcome to the world of spoonies.

If you‚Äôre not convinced, here is a helpful guide.

üíä Are you looking for submissions?

You bet! Got something great? Share it with us right here or @ us on a post!

üíä So what makes you a spoonie?

Okay, okay. Here‚Äôs my spoonie cred: chronic pain, SEID/CFS, POTS, IBS caused by SIBO, an undiagnosed connective tissue disorder, and an anxiety/depression to round it all off!
