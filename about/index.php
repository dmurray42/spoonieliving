	<h3>Inclusion &amp; Social Justice</h3>
	<p>We know what oppression feels like firsthand, and make it our goal to keep this blog a safe space for all marginalized groups&mdash;chronically ill and otherwise. Spoonie Living practices compassionate intersectional feminism by avoiding racist, appropriative, cissexist, and other -ist language in our original content, and tagging for the same in the content of others.</p>

	<p>We acknowledge that no one can be completely unproblematic all the time, so if you see something we‚Äôve overlooked, or simply have a personal trigger you‚Äôd like us to tag for, please feel free to check in via <a href="mailto:contact@spoonieliving.com">email</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/spoonieliving">Twitter</a>, or <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>. We‚Äôll always listen and take appropriate action.</p>

	<p>The term ‚Äúspoonie‚Äù refers to a person with a chronic illness of some type (mental or physical) that has a serious impact on their daily life. It comes from <a href="www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/">Christine Miserando‚Äôs Spoon Theory story</a>, and it resonated with so many people that it spawned its own term and is used by folks all over the world!</p>
