        What qualifies a person as a spoonie*? Oh boy, so many things! Mental illnesses, congenital conditions, intellectual disabilities, learning disorders... if something about your body (including your brain) is different, and makes it harder to get through your daily life, then congratulations: you're a spoonie.
