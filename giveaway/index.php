<h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>U.S.-only:</b> As much as we'd like to make this a worldwide giveaway, we're only able to mail the prize to a U.S. address. However, a U.S. residency or citizenship is not required.</li>
    <li><b>Permission required for minors:</b> If you are under 18, we will require contact with and consent from an adult resident at the address you provide before receiving the address and mailing the prize. We will only need this if you win, and would be absolutely happy to talk with a parent, guardian, or other addressee about any safety concerns.</li>
    <li><b>Entering on another person's behalf:</b> You're welcome to enter this giveaway with another person in mind as the final recipient, but if you win we'll need contact with and consent from them before receiving their address and mailing the package. The above rule for minors applies to the recipient as well.</li>
  </ul>
