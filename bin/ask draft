so i'm 21 and recently got diagnosed with ms, and it's been kind of hard with dealing with everything that goes with it being definitively that, like the possible/current symptoms, prognosis, meds, etc. what doesn't help is that i have to do all the research on it and the meds and everything because my parents won't and filter all of that and tell them the more light stuff (and the not so bad symptoms i have sometimes too) so they don't freak out and stuff. the dx alone is a lot to deal with.

Hey there, 

So sorry to hear it! You sound really stressed, and we'd love to see if we can help.

It sounds like you don’t have a very strong support system over there, which super sucks when you’re dealing with such a heavy diagnosis. You deserve to have people on your side. Is there anyone you've been talking to about all this, who you can trust not to freak out over the worst of it? If not, we'd recommend reaching out to other folks in your life, or joining a few spoonie support groups and finding others who understand what you're going through.

At 21, we think it's generally a good thing to be taking point on research and care management; however, we know that sometimes it's a bit more than one person can do. To help with the overwhelm, spend a little time thinking about what specific tasks you need help with, and figure out who you can delegate to. If you're having trouble picking people to ask, consider crowdsourcing and making an indirect ask by posting on social networks to find out who would be willing to volunteer their time. You might be surprised by who steps up!

Have you had much time with the doctor that diagnosed you? If not, it could be a good idea to make an appointment and sit down with them to ask some of the questions you have, as the doctor maybe be able to give you some big-picture answers that are hard to find in your research. Now could also be a great time for a second opinion if you can manage it, especially when it comes to prognosis and medication recommendations. Doctors can also point you towards formal resources that might distill some of the data into a more manageable format.

We're also thinking that your parents could use some resources you don't have to curate yourself. If they aren't willing to help you out with the research (and you may want to make sure your impression is true!), or you don't want them breathing down your neck, try giving them some resources directed at friends and family of folks with MS. 

Finally, we're getting the impression that you're really unhappy with the dynamic between you and your parents. Have you had a chance to sit down with them and hash things out since your diagnosis? Friends and family can sometimes be very clueless about what a loved one with a chronic illness needs from them, and since this is new territory, it's good to start off on the right foot. Consider what about the current dynamic is making you feel uncomfortable, and what sort of asks you can make to ease that. Our free zine, Chronically Badass, has a section on how to communicate needs and set boundaries, which you may find handy. You can find the text of this section on Spoon Shares, if you'd rather not bother with a whole PDF right now.

We hope this helps, friend, and that you're able to feel more on top of and confident about your illness. Sending love and spoons!
