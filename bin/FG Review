Review: Futura Genetics DNA Test

Heyo! This is editor Diane, here today to give you my review on a cool DNA test by Futura Genetics, which goes a little deeper than the ones that have been getting mainstream attention.

I was able to try out this test thanks to our partnership with the Chronic Illness Bloggers network, and I’ve got lots of info to help you decide whether this test is worth your time and money!

Here’s how it rated:

Overall: 2.5/5
★★½

Category: 
Commercial tests, genetics, prevention

Good for: 
Getting to know your body, assessing risks, planning for the future, mitigating future health problems

Design: 4/5
★★★★

Functionality: 3/5
★★★

Bang for your Buck: 2/5
★★

This one definitely ranked lower than some of the winners I’ve reviewed recently, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have merit! I’ll tell you more about why you might (or might not) want to give this a try, below the cut.

Disclosure: I have been given this product as part of a product review through the Chronic Illness Bloggers network. Although the product was a gift, all opinions in this review remain my own and I was in no way influenced by the company.

I am firmly in the “more information is better” camp, and I just love to plan ahead--so I jumped at the opportunity to get a DNA test of any kind. My partner got 23AndMe a while back and was super into the data they received, so I figured I’d enjoy giving it a whirl myself.

Unlike 23AndMe, Futura Genetics doesn’t gather info on who you are (ancestry, wellness, traits, and carrier status) so much as what you could be in the future: it lets you know what your risk factors are for certain diseases and conditions, and then provides info on how you can lower them if needed.

As someone who already has enough health problems to worry about, the ability to predict and prevent future ones is VERY appealing. I’m happy to say that for me, this test definitely provided. I’m now aware of two conditions that could affect my vision down the line (do not want!), and am planning two extremely concrete steps to prevent them. I’ll also be on guard for the symptoms now, which will help with early detection.* Being an empowered patient is so important, and I feel that this test really helped me with that.

The process of getting tested was very simple: they sent a little test kit my way, I spat in it and arranged a pickup, and then they sent me my results as a PDF. I took one star away for design, in part because it didn’t quite account for the lowest common denominator--me. I’m someone who reads instructions hastily and step-by-step rather than in full, so I made a couple gaffes and was mildly inconvenienced. Nothing awful, but if you do get this test, be sure to read the instructions carefully, as the test certainly isn’t goof-proof.

The reports produced were easy to read, with numbers for the numbers people, visual representations for visual folks, and detailed explanations of the conditions and prevention (including the genetic markers that were analyzed). Here’s an example--pretty good design, right?

If you want more than this little taster, you can see a full sample report right here. And, readers wondering what conditions are checked can find that info right here.

For those curious, it looks like the results aren’t perfectly accessible to screen readers, but it seems like you could get the info you need with a bit of work. I strongly suggest you look at the sample, though, as I don’t have a screen reader myself and am making a guess based on limited knowledge.

Now, onto my criticisms. First, the test asks for a binary gender, which isn’t super unexpected given that we’re squarely in the medical zone, but still a bit disappointing. I do wish there was a way to get a little more specific about what reproductive organs you have and how your hormones shake out, but I think we’ll need a bit more time before a mainstream medical test like this makes those considerations.

The biggest disappointment--and a huge dealbreaker--was this note in the report: “All risks are calculated based on the data collected from individuals of Caucasian ethnicity.” Gross! I’m white as hell, so it didn’t affect me or my result, but this is a serious blind spot that (if my not-very-educated-understanding is correct) makes the test a lot less accurate for a large group of people. With that in mind, I really can’t recommend this test to readers of color. And for white readers... consider spending your money on more inclusive companies that pull from broader demographics.

Finally, this genetic test is extremely cost-prohibitive. Getting genetic testing out-of-pocket is always going to be pretty spendy, but at $375, and with much less breadth and ongoing support & information than 23andMe’s $199 product, I'm giving this test a bit of a side-eye. That being said, I haven’t seen anything that tests for genetic risks specifically, so this might be your only option.

Overall, I’d say this test did what it advertised, but within a very limited range. They’re on a good track, but until their expand their dataset and cut their price, I hesitate to recommend it. Don’t just take my word for it, though--check it out for yourself!

*For those who are curious to hear my real-life example, I’m at a higher risk for Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Exfoliating Glaucoma. Moving forward, I plan to use sunglasses more frequently to protect my eyes (I barely use them right now) and talk to my doctor about weaning myself off of my steroidal eyedrops. I’m also on the lookout for symptoms of either condition, and will be asking my doctor to review my previous eye tests in case there are early warning signs.
